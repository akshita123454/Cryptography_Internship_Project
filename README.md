# DRDO Cryptography Project  
# P2P Secure Communication System (Internship Project 2025)

---

## Project Overview

This repository showcases the development of a **peer-to-peer secure communication system** as part of the DRDO Cryptography Project (2025). The focus of the project is on replicating essential components of the **SSL/TLS protocol**, including:

- Encryption and decryption using AES  
- SHA-based integrity checks  
- Secure file and message sharing  

The application is built using **Python** and is capable of secure messaging and file transfer between two or more clients across a network. Testing has been conducted using **multiple ports on the same system**.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

### Execution

Run two clients on different terminals (or different machines).

**Client 1 (Port 5000):**
```bash
python p2p_client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

**Client 2 (Port 5001):**
```bash
python p2p_client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001 --connect 127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Commands (Inside the Client)

- `/msg your_message` — Send an encrypted and hashed message  
- `/file path/to/filename` — Send a file securely with integrity check  

---

## Working Principle

### AES Encryption/Decryption

- Messages and files are encrypted using AES (CBC mode) with a shared symmetric key.  
- AES key is predefined or manually configured for both clients during testing.

### SHA-based Integrity Check

- Before sending any message or file, a SHA-256 hash is generated.  
- The receiver recalculates the hash to verify data integrity.  
- If hashes match, data is accepted; otherwise, an integrity error is raised.

---

## Sample Output

```
[INFO] AES encryption initialized.
[INFO] Encrypted message sent.
[INTEGRITY] SHA-256 Hash verified — message is authentic.
[FILE] Encrypted file received and saved.
```
