# Cryptography Project  
# P2P Secure Communication System (Internship Project 2025)

---

## Project Overview

This repository showcases the development of a **peer-to-peer secure communication system** as part of the DRDO Cryptography Project (2025). The focus of the project is on replicating essential components of the **SSL/TLS protocol**, including:

- Symmetric encryption and decryption using **AES (CBC mode)**  
- **SHA-256**-based HMAC integrity checks  
- Secure file and message sharing over **UDP sockets**  

The application is built using **Python** and is capable of secure messaging and file transfer between two or more clients across a network. Testing has been conducted using **multiple ports on the same system**.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install cryptography

```


### Execution

Run two clients on different terminals (or different machines).

**Client 1 (Port 5000):**
```bash
python p2p_client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

**Client 2 (Port 5001):**
```bash
python p2p_client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001 --connect 127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Commands 

```
msg     # Send an encrypted message with hash
file    # Send a file with encrypted content and integrity check
exit    # Exit the application


```

## Working Principle
### AES Encryption/Decryption
- The shared password is used to derive both:
    - a 32-byte AES key
    - a 32-byte HMAC key
- Data is padded using PKCS7, encrypted using AES in CBC mode, and sent with a random IV.
- The same process (in reverse) is used for decryption on the receiver side.

### SHA-256-Based Integrity Check
- A SHA-256 HMAC is computed for the encrypted content before sending.
- The receiver recalculates the HMAC to verify authenticity.
- If the HMAC verification fails, an integrity warning is raised and the data is rejected.

## Sample Output

```
Enter shared password: secret123
Enter your port: 5001
Enter peer's port: 5000
[LISTENING] on port 5001...

Type msg / file / exit: msg
Enter message: Hello peer!
[SENT] Encrypted message sent.

[MESSAGE from ('127.0.0.1', 5000)] Hello peer!

```
