# DRDO Cryptography Project  
# P2P Secure Communication System (Internship Project 2025)

---

## Project Overview

This repository showcases the development of a **peer-to-peer secure communication system** as part of the DRDO Cryptography Project (2025). The focus of the project is on replicating essential components of the **SSL/TLS protocol**, including:

- Encryption and decryption using AES  
- SHA-based integrity checks  
- Peer-to-peer communication over UDP sockets  

The application is built using **Python** and is capable of secure messaging and file transfer between two or more clients across a network. Testing has been conducted using **multiple ports on the same system**.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

No external Python libraries are required — everything uses built-in modules only.


### Execution

Run two clients on different terminals (or different machines).

**Client 1 (Port 5000):**
```bash
python p2p_client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

**Client 2 (Port 5001):**
```bash
python p2p_client.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001 --connect 127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Commands 

```
msg     # Send an encrypted message with hash
file    # Send a file with encrypted content and integrity check
exit    # Exit the application


```

## Working Principle

### Encryption/Decryption

- The shared password is converted into a fixed-length 32-byte key.  
- Messages and files are encrypted using XOR-based symmetric encryption.
- The same function is used to decrypt on the receiver side using the shared key.

### Hash-Based Integrity Check

- A custom hash function (not SHA) is used:
  -The hash is a 16-byte checksum based on simple XOR and modulo operations. 
- The hash is appended before encryption.  
- On receiving, the receiver decrypts, separates the hash, and recomputes it to verify authenticity.
- If the hashes do not match, the data is rejected with an integrity warning.

## Sample Output

```
Enter your listening port (e.g., 5001): 5001
Enter target peer's port (e.g., 5002): 5002
[LISTENING] on port 5001...
Enter command ('msg', 'file', 'exit'): msg
Enter message: Hello peer!
[SENT] Encrypted message with hash sent.

[MESSAGE from ('127.0.0.1', 5002)] Hello peer!

```
